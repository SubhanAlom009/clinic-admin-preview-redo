## [2025-09-04] Added/Fixed

### 🔧 UI & Calendar Features
- Fixed notification queries and refetch logic across the app to use the `status` column (values: `unread` / `read`) instead of a boolean `read` column — resolved 400 errors when marking notifications as read (see `src/components/Layout.tsx` and `src/components/NotificationCenter.tsx`).
- Implemented a production-ready calendar view component at `src/components/CalendarView.tsx` using `react-big-calendar`.
	- Calendar shows appointments with color-coded status badges, a custom toolbar, and an appointment details modal with quick status actions.
- Integrated the calendar into the Appointments page (`src/pages/Appointments.tsx`) and added a view toggle (list ↔ calendar).
- Aligned the Calendar component with existing DB/types (used `appointment_datetime`, `duration_minutes`, `patients.name`, `doctors.name`, etc.) and adjusted the queries to fetch related patient/doctor rows.
- Addressed several TypeScript/type mismatches while wiring the calendar and appointments integration; added small, explicit type casts where needed to work around Supabase client typing for updates (temporary, low-risk).
- Improved status update flow for appointments (client mutation + query invalidation) and added UI controls to mark Check-In / Start / Complete / No-Show / Cancel from the calendar event modal.
- Minor UI and accessibility tweaks: toolbar buttons, status badge styling, and loading state for calendar.
- Added Company logo in the header of the `layout` component for consistent branding across all pages.
- Fixed the collapsable sidebar to ensure it works correctly on all screen sizes.
- Added a `Go back to Home` button in the header of the dashboard to allow users to easily navigate back to the landing page.
- Updated the `landing page` navbar so that after signing in, the user's information (such as name or clinic name) is displayed instead of the "Sign In" button, providing a personalized experience.

### 🚀 **MAJOR: Database Schema Consolidation**
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Consolidated 4+ fragmented migration files into 2 comprehensive, production-ready migrations:
  - `20250904_comprehensive_schema.sql` - Complete clinic database schema (600+ lines)
  - `20250904_queue_functions.sql` - Advanced queue management functions (400+ lines)
- **Moved old migrations to `backup_old_migrations/` folder** to prevent conflicts and schema duplication issues
- **Enhanced appointment system** with advanced queue management:
  - Queue positions, ETAs, check-in status tracking
  - Real-time queue recalculation with PostgreSQL functions
  - Distributed locking system for concurrent operations
  - Event-driven notifications and job processing
- **Added robust tables**:
  - `job_queue` - Background job processing with retry logic
  - `notification_queue` - SMS/Email notification delivery system
  - `appointment_events` - Complete audit trail for all appointment changes
  - `doctor_schedules` & `doctor_breaks` - Advanced scheduling constraints
  - `queue_locks` - Distributed locking for concurrent queue operations
- **Production-grade optimizations**:
  - Strategic database indexes for performance
  - Automatic timestamp triggers
  - Row-level security policies
  - Data validation constraints

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Fixed architecture issue**: Eliminated schema proliferation that was causing deployment conflicts
- **Performance optimizations**: Added indexes for queue operations, appointment lookups, and analytics
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling in PostgreSQL functions with proper lock management
- **Scalability**: Designed for multiple clinics with proper user isolation and concurrent operations

Notes:
- **IMPORTANT**: Old migration files are safely backed up but should be replaced with the new consolidated schema
- The new schema is fully backward compatible with existing appointment data
- Some Supabase typing issues required explicit casts in a few update calls; these are noted in the code and can be refined by tightening the `Database` typings if desired.
- Enhanced queue management now supports real-time ETA calculations and automatic notifications

## [2025-09-05] Added/Fixed

### 🔧 Urgent Fixes (database & API)
- Fixed appointment status constraint and standardized status values to lowercase to prevent insertion errors (resolved "new row for relation 'appointments' violates check constraint 'appointments_status_check'").
- Added missing appointment columns required by queue management and ETA calculations: `patient_checked_in`, `checked_in_at`, `estimated_start_time`, `actual_start_time`, `actual_end_time`, `queue_position`, `expected_duration_minutes`.
- Created `job_queue` and `notification_queue` tables and added migrations to resolve PostgREST schema errors and enable background job processing.
- Consolidated and fixed several migrations to ensure schema cache consistency and added safe refactor migrations under `supabase/migrations/`.


### 🎨 UI / Calendar / Modal
- Redesigned calendar to a minimal, professional aesthetic with light orange/rose headers and subtle status-based colors for events.
- Reworked calendar `CustomToolbar` buttons (Today / Prev / Next / View toggles) to use the new orange-themed styles.
- Implemented status-based event classes and moved styling to `src/components/CalendarView.css`.
- Reworked `AppointmentDetailsModal`:
  - Removed emojis and simplified layout for a clean, professional look.
  - Moved Date & Time to the top-right of the modal in small text.
  - Added clear Patient and Doctor information sections (contact, email, age, gender, specialization, fees).
  - Replaced JSON medical-history display with plain text handling (accepts string or comma-separated arrays and renders as comma-separated text).
  - Added timing fields display: Checked-in time, Started, Ended, ETA.
  - Added derived timing analytics: Waiting Time, Consultation Duration, Schedule Variance, Total Time (scheduled→completion).
  - Improved action button flow: updates now refresh local modal state and keep the modal open for Completed appointments so you can see timing details.

### 🛠 Code / Types
- Aligned frontend enums/constants (`AppointmentStatus`) with database constraints and converted usage to enum constants to avoid mismatches.
- Fixed TypeScript mismatches in `AppointmentDetailsModal` and `CalendarView` by replacing string literals with `AppointmentStatus` enum values.
- Applied small type-safety improvements and replaced `any` usage with `unknown` or more specific types where possible.

### ✅ Notes & Follow-ups
- After these changes, test the appointment flow: create, check-in, start, complete — ensure `checked_in_at`, `actual_start_time`, and `actual_end_time` are persisted and shown in the modal.
- Next recommended steps: integrate quick billing from the Completed modal, enable real-time queue updates with Supabase subscriptions, and add small analytics (average wait/consult times) on the Dashboard.

## [2025-09-06] Added / Fixed

- We fixed how consultation time is recorded in the UI: the planned `duration_minutes` is preserved and measured consultation time is stored/shown separately so you can compare Planned vs Actual.
- Added a short note file `APPOINTMENT_DURATION_ETA_FIXES.md` that explains the change, how to test it, and what to check before a demo.

## [2025-09-07] Removed / Changed

- Hid ETA from the frontend (Appointments list and details modal). ETA and queue calculations are now handled on the server side.
- Stopped setting `estimated_start_time` from the client when creating appointments to avoid conflicting calculations.

## [2025-09-08] Refactor / Housekeeping

- Renamed the UI button to `Button` (capitalized) and cleaned up the imports across the app.
- Made a couple of small TypeScript adjustments around appointment update types to accept the new duration-related fields.

## [2025-09-09] QA / Demo Prep

- Ran a quick smoke test of the full appointment flow (create → check-in → start → complete). After completing an appointment the modal stays open so timing details are visible for verification.
- Polished labels and the timing display in the appointment modal so Planned vs Actual numbers are clear.

## [2025-09-10] Notes & Follow-ups

- Recommendation: add a small DB migration to persist `actual_duration_minutes` (integer) if you want to store measured durations on the server. Without it the UI will compute actual time from timestamps but not persist a separate measured value.
- ETA / queue recalculation logic remains in the DB functions/migrations — frontend no longer writes or displays ETA values.

## [2025-09-12] Major Queue System Fixes

### 🚀 **CRITICAL: Queue Management & Appointment Visibility Issues Resolved**
- **Fixed appointment visibility bug**: Resolved issue where only the first created appointment was showing in queue views.
- **Fixed queue position calculation errors**: Queue positions now properly recalculate when appointments are completed, maintaining sequential numbering (1, 2, 3...).
- **Resolved toast notification inaccuracies**: Add delay functionality now shows correct appointment counts, excluding completed appointments.
- **Fixed emergency patient selection**: Emergency appointment modal now shows all available patients instead of filtering by existing appointments.

### 🔧 **Technical Queue System Improvements**
- **Standardized status filtering**: Unified all queue operations to use consistent `.neq("status", AppointmentStatus.COMPLETED)` filtering across QueueManagementModal and QueueTab components.
- **Fixed appointment ordering logic**: Changed AppointmentService ordering to `nullsFirst: true` for queue_position, ensuring new appointments appear at the top instead of being hidden at the bottom.
- **Resolved doctor auto-selection race condition**: Fixed timing issue where fetchQueue was called before doctors were loaded, preventing appointment display.
- **Enhanced queue recalculation**: Queue positions now properly exclude completed appointments and automatically renumber active appointments starting from position 1.

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes**
- **Emergency appointments**: Fixed filtering to show all user patients, not just those with existing appointments on selected date.
- **Real-time updates**: Improved useEffect dependencies to prevent multiple unnecessary queue fetches.
- **Debug logging**: Added comprehensive logging for queue operations and doctor selection to aid troubleshooting.
- **Status enum consistency**: Ensured all status filtering uses lowercase values matching database constraints.

### ✅ **Queue System Now Fully Functional**
- ✅ New appointments appear immediately in queue views
- ✅ Queue positions update correctly when appointments are completed  
- ✅ Add delay affects only active appointments with accurate counts
- ✅ Emergency appointments can be created for any patient
- ✅ Doctor auto-selection works reliably without race conditions
- ✅ Real-time subscription updates preserved across all views

## [2025-09-11] Hotfixes / Final Prep

- Removed the last ETA references from the frontend and ensured new appointments do not set `estimated_start_time` from the client.
- Did a repo-wide check after renaming the button component to make sure imports weren't broken.
- Added a short demo checklist and smoke-test steps to the repo so you can run through the presentation quickly.
